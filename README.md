# Tracking putative Microcystis viruses and virus-host interactions across distinct phases of a Microcystis-dominated bloom

Repository to accompany "Tracking putative Microcystis viruses and virus-host interactions across distinct phases of a Microcystis-dominated bloom", Wing, et al. 2025.

This code provides the scripts necessary to replicate the analyses described in the paper.

## Identify viral contigs

## Build high confidence viral otus

## Taxonomy and functional annotation of hosts and votus

## Analyze diversity and function of viral populations in R
